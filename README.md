# Peregrinate #

This website was developed during the course TDT4140 - Programvareutvikling. It is a website that allows users to post their own backpacking trips, and interect with other trips through liking, commenting, filtering etc. The product was developed by a team consisting of three computer science students, two industrial economy and technology management students, and one engineering and ICT student.

The purpose of the website was to correctly utilize Scrum-methodology in order to accomodate and implement requirements set by a product owner. Due to the fact that the primary focus in the course was on the process (agile methodology, team collaboration etc.) as opposed to product quality, there are still some missing user stories. The website could also benefit from some improvements (such as better design, smoother UX experience etc). The functionality implemented is nonetheless in an acceptable, working condition.

## How to run the application ##
N.B: MongoDB dotenv is not provided, meaning that the website functionality is not accessible. Interface can still be interacted with to a very limited degree however. The purpose of this repo is to primarily show the code.

- Navigate to the 'server'-folder in your terminal, and run the following command:
``` npm install ``` then ```npm start```.

- Open a second terminal, navigate to the 'client'-folder and run the same commands as in the previous step. This should open the site in your default browser.

- A test user with the username 'Test123' and password 'Test123' has been created for the purposes of checking out the site. Alternatively, you may also create your own account.
